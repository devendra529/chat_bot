Natural Language Processing (NLP): It uses nltk for text preprocessing and intent classification.

Machine Learning Model: The chatbot uses Logistic Regression for predicting the user's intent based on input text.

Flask Web App: The chatbot is deployed on a simple web application built with Flask.

Multiple Intents: It can handle various queries such as greetings, jokes, time, favorite colors, and more.

# Technologies Used
